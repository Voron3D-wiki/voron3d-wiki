# Multi-Material UNIT Systems (MMUs)

## Introduction
Multi-Material Upgrade (MMU) systems allow 3D printers to print with multiple filaments in a single print. These systems enable multi-color, multi-material printing and provide flexibility for complex models. Below is a list of popular MMU systems with links, images, and brief descriptions.

## Filament Swapping systems (MMU2)

### 1. **Prusa Design MMU2/MMU3**
- **Description**: An innovative add-on for Prusa 3D printers, supporting up to five filaments for multi-color and multi-material prints.
- **Key Features**:
  - Supports up to 5 colors/materials.
  - Automatic filament loading/unloading.
  - Integrated with PrusaSlicer for seamless operation.
  - Reliable filament sensor to detect jams or misfeeds.
