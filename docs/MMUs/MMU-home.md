# Multi-Material Upgrade Systems (MMUs)

## Introduction
Multi-Material Upgrade (MMU) systems allow 3D printers to print with multiple filaments in a single print. These systems enable multi-color, multi-material printing and provide flexibility for complex models. Below is a list of popular MMU systems with links, images, and brief descriptions.

## Key Features of MMU Systems
- **Multi-Color Prints**: Print models with multiple colors seamlessly.
- **Multi-Material Capability**: Combine different material properties, e.g., flexible and rigid.
- **Automated Filament Changes**: Simplifies filament swaps during a print.
- **Dissolvable Supports**: Use soluble support materials for complex overhangs.
