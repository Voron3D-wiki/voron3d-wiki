# Multi-Material Units (MMUs)

## Overview
Multi-Material Upgrade (MMU) systems allow 3D printers to print with multiple filaments in a single print. These systems enable multi-color, multi-material printing and provide flexibility for complex models. Below is a list of popular MMU systems with links, images, and brief descriptions.

### [ERCF (Enraged Rabbit Carrot Feeder)](ERCF.md)
- **Description**: A community-driven MMU system designed for high reliability and extensive customization.
- **Key Features**:
    - Supports up to 12 colors/materials
    - Highly customizable with modular components
    - Extensive community support and documentation
    - Advanced filament path control for reduced tangling

### [PICO-MMU](PICO-MMU.md)
- **Description**: A very interesting project by [Ihndo](https://github.com/lhndo), the creator of the [LH-Stinger](https://github.com/lhndo/LH-Stinger).
- **Key Features**:
    - Compact design for all printers
    - Supports up to 4 colors/materials
    - Open-source and customizable
    - Lightweight and easy to assemble

### [BoxTurtle](BoxTurtle.md)
- **Description**: An open-source multi-material system that supports 4 spools (unsure if they can be daisy-chained). Includes an auto-rewinding system, and a kit can be purchased through LDO Motors.
- **Key Features**:
    - Supports up to 4 colors/materials (per boxturtle)
    - Auto-rewinding system for unused filaments
    - Open-source with detailed documentation
    - Designed for compatibility with Klipper firmware
    - heated enclsure optional

### [TradRack](tradrack.md)
- **Description**: A similar system to the ERCF, the TradRack is designed by Annex Engineering.
- **Key Features**:
    - Modular design for easy expansion
    - Supports up to 14 colors/materials
    - Compatible with various slicers
    - Designed for high-speed filament swapping

## Commercial Options

### BTT MMU
- **Description**: A BigTreeTech MMU system that offers integration with their control boards and firmware. At this time, there is not much known.
- **Key Features**: 
    - Seems like a AMS style system with space for 4 spoos

### Anycubic MMU
- **Description**: Anycubic's solution for multi-material printing, originally released with the Kobra 3 3D printer. It will soon be supported by the upcoming Anycubic S1 as well.
- **Key Features**:
    - Supports up to 4 colors/materials

### Prusa MMU
- **Description**: An innovative add-on for Prusa 3D printers, supporting up to five filaments for multi-color and multi-material prints.
- **Key Features**:
    - Automatic filament loading/unloading
    - Integrated with PrusaSlicer for seamless operation

   - Easy: Commercial solutions
   - Moderate: PICO-MMU, TradRack
   - Advanced: ERCF, Box Turtle

3. **Cost Considerations**
   - Budget: TradRack, Anycubic MMU
   - Mid-range: PICO-MMU, BTT MMU
   - High-end: ERCF, Box Turtle

4. **Maintenance Requirements**
   - Low: Commercial solutions
   - Medium: PICO-MMU
   - High: ERCF, Box Turtle

## Technical Considerations

### Software Requirements
- Klipper integration
- Slicer settings
