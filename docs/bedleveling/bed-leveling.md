# Bed Leveling

Bed leveling ensures that the surface of the print bed is perfectly spaced from the nozzle of the printer across the entire build area. Without proper leveling, the first layer may be too close or too far from the print bed, causing issues such as poor adhesion or nozzle clogs. A well-leveled bed is essential for ensuring a successful print.

## Mesh Leveling

Mesh leveling, also known as "mesh bed leveling," is a process that creates a virtual map of a 3D printer’s bed by measuring its surface at multiple points. This allows the printer to dynamically adjust the nozzle height during printing, compensating for any unevenness. A level print bed is critical for successful 3D prints, especially for achieving a smooth first layer. By correcting small imperfections or warps in the bed, mesh leveling ensures the nozzle maintains an even distance across the surface, resulting in better first-layer adhesion and more reliable prints. It’s particularly useful for anyone with a printer that has an uneven or warped bed or for those seeking precise prints across the entire bed surface.
