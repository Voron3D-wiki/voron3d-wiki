# Cartographer Probe

The Cartographer Probe is an innovative sensor designed for 3D printers to achieve precise bed leveling and height mapping. It uses changes in frequency slopes to detect nozzle contact with the bed, offering a unique approach to bed probing.

## Features

- **Frequency-Based Detection**: The probe detects changes in the slope of frequency values, allowing it to determine when the nozzle touches the bed.
- **No Temperature Compensation Needed**: Since it relies on slope changes rather than absolute frequency values, it is unaffected by coil temperature variations.
- **Metal-Induced Electric Field**: The probe works by inducing an electric field into the closest metal body, such as the spring steel sheet or the bed itself.
- **Versatile Probing Actions**: Supports SCAN Z homing, SCAN bed mesh, and QGL/Z-Tilt, all based on frequency variations.

## Benefits

- **High Precision**: The slope-based detection ensures accurate nozzle-to-bed contact, improving first-layer adhesion and print quality.
- **Temperature Independence**: Eliminates the need for temperature compensation, simplifying setup and reducing potential errors.
- **System Offset Stability**: The fixed offset accounts for system-wide factors like thermal expansion and flex, ensuring consistent performance even with nozzle or sheet changes.

## Drawbacks

- **Metal Dependency**: Requires a metal surface within a few millimeters for proper operation, limiting compatibility with non-metal beds.
- **Setup Sensitivity**: Proper mounting and alignment are critical for consistent results, as deviations can lead to probing inaccuracies.
- **Environmental Factors**: Flex in the toolhead, bed, or other components can introduce noise, requiring additional calibration.

## Firmware Setup

To configure the Cartographer Probe in your firmware, follow the official [firmware setup guide](https://docs.cartographer3d.com/cartographer-probe/firmware). This guide provides detailed instructions for integrating the probe with your printer's firmware, including configuration examples and troubleshooting tips.

## Fine-Tuning

For optimal performance, fine-tuning the Cartographer Probe is essential. The official [fine-tuning guide](https://docs.cartographer3d.com/cartographer-probe/fine-tuning) covers methods for calibrating the probe, including:

- **Setting Models for Different Beds/Temperatures**: Adjusting the probe for various bed materials and temperature conditions.
- **Temperature Differential Calibration**: Ensuring accuracy across different operating temperatures.
- **Useful Macros**: Leveraging macros to streamline calibration and improve usability.

  - **STEP**: Increment for threshold. Default: `250`.
  - **QUALIFY_SAMPLES**: Samples for qualification. Default: `5`.
  - **VERIFY_SAMPLES**: Samples for verification. Default: `5`.

### Printer.cfg Settings

These settings are available but typically do not require modification:
- **sensor**: Default: `cartographer`.
- **speed**: Default: `5.0`. Min: `0.0`.
- **x_offset**: X offset from the nozzle. Default: `0.0`.
- **y_offset**: Y offset from the nozzle. Default: `0.0`.
- **z_hop_dist**: Default: `5.0`. Min: `0.0`.
- **mode**: Default: `scan`. Options: `scan` or `touch`.
- **trigger_distance**: Default: `2.0`.

## How It Works

The Cartographer Probe operates by detecting changes in the rate of frequency slope as the nozzle approaches the bed. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Inducing an Electric Field**: The probe generates an electric field into the nearest metal surface.
2. **Frequency Slope Monitoring**: As the nozzle moves closer to the bed, the frequency value increases at a predictable rate.
3. **Slope Change Detection**: When the nozzle touches the bed, the slope flattens, signaling the probe to stop.
4. **Probing Actions**:
   - **SCAN Z Homing**: Triggers at a specific frequency to determine the Z height.
   - **SCAN Bed Mesh**: Maps the bed surface based on frequency variations.
   - **Survey Nozzle Probing**: Calculates the Z difference between the trigger frequency and the nozzle height.

## Usage Tips

- Ensure the probe is mounted 2.6â€“3mm above the nozzle tip for optimal performance.
- Verify the rigidity of the toolhead and check for loose screws or bad wiring.
- Maintain clean nozzles and proper belt tension to minimize probing errors.
- Disable features like crowsnest, adaptive mesh, or LED effects if experiencing inconsistent results.
