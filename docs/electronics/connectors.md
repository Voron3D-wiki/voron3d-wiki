### JST Connectors
- **Description**: Compact connectors available in various pin counts and configurations
- **Common Uses**: 
  - Endstop wiring
  - Fan connections
  - Low-current sensor connections
- **Variants**:
  - JST-XH: Common for endstops and sensors
  - JST-PH: Used for smaller electronics and breakout boards

### Molex Connectors
- **Description**: Reliable connectors with positive locking for secure connections
- **Common Uses**: 
  - Power distribution
  - Stepper motor connections
  - Heater cartridge wiring

## Wiring Best Practices

### Wire Gauges
- **High Current Applications** (>5A):
  - 18-20 AWG for heater cartridges and power distribution
  - 20-22 AWG for stepper motors
- **Low Current Applications** (<5A):
  - 22-24 AWG for endstops and sensors
  - 24-26 AWG for signal wires

### Wire Management
- Use cable chains or conduits to protect wires
- Implement strain relief at connection points
- Separate high-voltage and low-voltage/signal wires
- Label all connections for easier troubleshooting

## Component-Specific Recommendations

### Heated Bed Wiring
- Use 16-18 AWG silicone wire for main power
- Implement proper strain relief at bed connection
- Consider using high-temperature-rated connectors

### Toolhead Wiring
- Use flexible silicone wires to minimize drag
- Implement proper cable management to reduce wear
- Consider CAN bus or similar solutions to reduce wire count

### Electronics Bay
- Maintain proper airflow around electronics
- Use consistent wire colors for easier identification
- Implement cable management to avoid interference
