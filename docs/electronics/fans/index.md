# Part Cooling

## Overview
This section covers part cooling solutions for Voron printers.

## How to choose a fan

Performance (generally) goes up with rpm, but not always.  The design of the fan will have an impact on the performance of the fan. Larger fans will often be able to move a higher volume of air at a lower rpm, this can help with noise. But the noise level of the fan is also impacted by many other things ranging of the mount used, the power supplied to the fan, the quality of the bearings, etc.
