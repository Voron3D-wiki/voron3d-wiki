# Electronics Safety Guide

## Basic Safety Rules

### Power Safety
1. Always disconnect power before working on electronics
2. Use proper insulation and wire gauges
3. Check for shorts before powering on
4. Use fuses and circuit protection

### Workspace Safety
1. Keep workspace clean and organized
2. Use ESD protection when handling components
3. Have proper ventilation
4. Keep fire extinguisher nearby

## Wiring Guidelines

### Wire Selection
| Component | Recommended Gauge | Current Rating |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| Heater | 14-16 AWG | 15-20A |
| Motors | 20-22 AWG | 2-5A |
| Fans | 24-26 AWG | 0.5-1A |
| Sensors | 24-26 AWG | <0.1A |

### Connection Methods
1. Proper crimping techniques
2. Heat shrink tubing usage
3. Wire management
4. Strain relief

## Testing Procedures

### Before Power-Up
```bash title="Safety Checklist"
1. Check all connections
2. Verify wire polarity
3. Test continuity
4. Inspect insulation
```

### First Power-On
1. Use current-limited power supply
2. Monitor temperature
3. Check for unusual smells/sounds
4. Verify voltage levels

## Emergency Procedures

### In Case of Fire
1. Disconnect power
2. Use appropriate fire extinguisher
3. Evacuate if necessary
4. Call emergency services

### Electrical Shock
1. Cut power immediately
2. Do not touch victim directly
3. Use non-conductive tool to separate
4. Seek medical attention
