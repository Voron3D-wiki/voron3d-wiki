# Stepper Driver Guide

## Overview
This guide covers the selection and configuration of stepper drivers for Voron printers, with a focus on performance and reliability.

## Driver Selection

### Key Features
| Feature | Importance | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Current Rating | High | 2A RMS minimum |
| Microstepping | High | 256 recommended |
| UART/SPI | High | For configuration |
| StealthChop | Medium | For quiet operation |

### Recommended Drivers
```text title="Popular Options"
TMC2209:
- 2A RMS current
- UART configuration
- StealthChop2
- Sensorless homing

TMC5160:
- 3A RMS current
- SPI configuration
- SpreadCycle
- Advanced features

TMC2240:
- 2.5A RMS current
- UART/SPI
- StealthChop2
- Cost effective
```

## Configuration

### Current Settings
| Motor | Current (RMS) | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| X/Y | 0.8-1.2A | CoreXY motors |
| Z | 0.8-1.0A | Lead screw |
| E | 0.8-1.0A | Extruder |

### UART Configuration
```python title="Example Config"
[tmc2209 stepper_x]
uart_pin: PC11
tx_pin: PC10
uart_address: 0
run_current: 0.8
hold_current: 0.5
stealthchop_threshold: 999999
```

## Performance Tuning

### SpreadCycle vs StealthChop
1. SpreadCycle: Better performance
2. StealthChop: Quieter operation
3. Hybrid mode: Best of both

### Sensorless Homing
```python title="Sensorless Config"
[tmc2209 stepper_x]
diag_pin: ^PC2
driver_SGTHRS: 255
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Motor noise | Current too high | Reduce current |
| Lost steps | Current too low | Increase current |
| No movement | Wrong UART addr | Check address |
| Overheating | Poor cooling | Add heatsink |

### Diagnostic Steps
1. Check current settings
2. Verify UART connection
3. Test motor movement
4. Monitor temperature
