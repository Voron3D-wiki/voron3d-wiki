# Flashing RP2040 from a Linux-based Klipper Environment

This guide explains how to flash firmware onto an RP2040 microcontroller using a Linux-based Klipper environment.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux-based system with Klipper installed
- RP2040-based board (e.g., Raspberry Pi Pico)
- USB cable
- Klipper source code

---

## Steps to Flash the RP2040

1. **Enter Bootloader Mode**
   - Hold down the **BOOTSEL** button on the RP2040 board.
   - While holding the button, connect the board to your computer via USB.
   - Release the button once the board is connected. It should appear as a mass storage device.

2. **Access the Klipper Directory**
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the Klipper source directory:
     ```bash
     cd ~/klipper
     ```

3. **Configure the Firmware**
   - Run the following command to configure the firmware:
     ```bash
     make clean #optional
     make menuconfig
     ```
   - In the menu:
     - Set the **Micro-controller Architecture** to `RP2040`.
     - Set the **Processor model** to match your board (e.g., `rp2040`).
     - Configure any additional options as needed for your setup.
   - Save and exit the configuration menu.

4. **Build the Firmware**
   - Compile the firmware by running:
     ```bash
     make
     ```
   - The compiled firmware will be saved as `klipper.uf2` in the `out` directory.

5. **Flash the Firmware**
   - flash the board - lsusb to get id
     ```bash
     make flash FLASH_DEVICE=[add device ID here]
     ```
   - The board will automatically reboot after the file is copied.

6. **Verify the Connection**
   - Check if the board is detected by running:
     ```bash
     ls /dev/serial/by-id/
     ```
   - Note the device ID for use in your Klipper configuration.

## Additional Notes

- If the board does not appear as a mass storage device, ensure the USB cable is functional and supports data transfer.
- For more details on configuring Klipper, refer to the [Klipper documentation](https://www.klipper3d.org/).
