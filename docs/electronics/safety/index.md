# Electrical Safety

## Overview

Electrical safety is paramount when working with 3D printers. This guide covers essential safety practices and considerations for working with electrical components in your Voron printer.

## Key Safety Principles

### 1. Power Supply Safety

- Always use a properly rated power supply for your printer
- Ensure proper grounding of the power supply
- Never modify or bypass safety features
- Use appropriate gauge wires for power connections
- Install proper fuses and circuit breakers

### 2. Wiring Safety

- Use proper wire gauges for current requirements
- Ensure all connections are secure and properly insulated
- Avoid sharp bends in wires
- Keep wires away from moving parts
- Use strain relief where appropriate

### 3. Component Safety

- Never exceed rated voltages or currents
- Use appropriate connectors for the application
- Ensure proper cooling for power components
- Follow manufacturer specifications
- Use quality components from reputable sources

## Common Hazards

### 1. Electrical Shock

- Always disconnect power before working on electrical components
- Use insulated tools
- Wear appropriate personal protective equipment
- Never work on live circuits
- Keep work area dry

### 2. Fire Hazards

- Monitor for overheating components
- Keep flammable materials away from electrical components
- Install smoke detectors
- Have appropriate fire extinguishers available
- Regular inspection of wiring and components

### 3. Component Damage

- Follow proper polarity
- Use appropriate voltage regulators
- Protect against voltage spikes
- Implement proper fusing
- Use appropriate current limiting

## Best Practices

### 1. Installation

- Follow manufacturer guidelines
- Use proper mounting hardware
- Ensure adequate ventilation
- Implement proper cable management
- Document all modifications

### 2. Maintenance
