### [MKS THR36 & THR42 Toolhead Board](./MKS-THR.md)

The MKS THR36 & THR42 series of toolhead boards are designed to work with any printer that supports CAN bus or USB communication. These boards require either 24V or 12V power to operate, which is used to power the heater. They serve as a compelling alternative to BTT and Mellow boards due to their inclusion of three independently controllable fans.
