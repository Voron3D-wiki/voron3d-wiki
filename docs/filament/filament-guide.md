# Filament Guide

## Introduction
Filament selection plays a crucial role in 3D printing success. This guide covers common filament types, their properties, and printing recommendations to help you choose the right material for your projects.

## Common Filament Types

### PLA (Polylactic Acid)
- **Properties**:
  - Biodegradable
  - Easy to print
  - Low warping
  - Limited heat resistance
- **Printing Temperature**: 190-220°C
- **Bed Temperature**: 50-60°C or room temperature
- **Best For**: 
  - Beginners
  - Decorative items
  - Low-stress parts
- **Purchase Options**:

### PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol)
- **Properties**:
  - Good strength
  - Chemical resistance
  - Moderate heat resistance
  - Low warping
- **Printing Temperature**: 230-250°C
- **Bed Temperature**: 70-80°C
- **Best For**: 
  - Functional parts
  - Outdoor use
  - Food-safe applications (with proper treatment)

### ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene)
- **Properties**:
  - High heat resistance
  - Durable
  - Chemical resistant
  - Prone to warping
- **Printing Temperature**: 230-250°C
- **Bed Temperature**: 90-110°C
- **Best For**: 
  - Mechanical parts
  - Automotive applications
  - Heat-resistant items

### TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane)
- **Properties**:
  - Flexible
  - Excellent impact resistance
  - Abrasion resistant
  - Challenging to print
- **Printing Temperature**: 220-250°C
- **Bed Temperature**: 50-60°C
- **Best For**: 
  - Flexible parts
  - Vibration dampening
  - Protective cases

## Printing Recommendations

### Storage
- Store filament in airtight containers with desiccant
- Keep away from humidity and direct sunlight
- Some filaments (Nylon, TPU) require active drying before printing

### Printer Setup
- Use appropriate bed adhesion methods (PEI, glue stick, etc.)
- Consider enclosure for temperature-sensitive materials (ABS, Nylon)
- Adjust cooling fans based on material requirements

### Print Settings
- **Layer Height**: 0.1-0.3mm depending on detail requirements
- **Print Speed**: Reduce for challenging materials
- **Retraction**: Adjust based on material stringing characteristics
- **First Layer**: Slower speed and higher temperature for better adhesion

## Specialty Filaments

### Carbon Fiber Reinforced
- **Properties**: Increased stiffness, dimensional stability
- **Considerations**: Abrasive to nozzles, requires hardened components

### Wood-Filled
- **Properties**: Wood-like appearance and feel
- **Considerations**: Variable temperature printing for different "burn" effects

### Metal-Filled
- **Properties**: Metallic appearance, increased weight
- **Considerations**: Highly abrasive, can be polished for metallic finish

## Troubleshooting

### Stringing
- Increase retraction distance
- Lower printing temperature
- Adjust travel speed

### Warping
- Increase bed temperature
- Use enclosure for high-temperature materials
- Apply proper bed adhesion techniques

### Moisture Issues
- Dry filament before printing
- Store properly
- Consider filament dryer for hygroscopic materials
