# Welcome to the Voron3D Wiki

Voron Design is a community-driven project focused on the creation of high-performance, fully customizable 3D printers. The project was founded in 2015 by a group of 3D printing enthusiasts who wanted to build printers that prioritize reliability, quality, and engineering excellence. Voron printers are designed for enthusiasts and professionals alike who are looking for a robust platform to support continuous innovation.

## What is Voron?

The Voron project revolves around open-source 3D printers that are known for their modularity, precision, and high print quality. These machines are highly customizable and can be tailored to individual needs, whether for personal, professional, or industrial use. The key feature of Voron printers is the communityâ€™s commitment to improving every aspect of the design, including mechanics, electronics, and firmware.

## History and Origins

Voron started in 2015 as a small project by its founder, VoronDesign, aiming to improve existing printer designs for personal use. As interest grew, so did the community around it, and by 2017, Voron had evolved into a comprehensive open-source project. Today, Voron is maintained by a passionate community of designers, engineers, and makers who contribute their expertise to continually refine the project.
