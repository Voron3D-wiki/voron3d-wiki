# Welcome to the Voron3D Wiki

![Voron3D Logo](../assets/VoronLogo.png){ width="250" align="right" }

This wiki is not affiliated with the offical voron design team, we are simply a community of enthusiasts who are passionate about 3D printing and Voron printers. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in learning more about Voron 3D printers and their unique features.

## What is Voron? { #what-is-voron }

The Voron project revolves around open-source 3D printers that are known for their modularity, precision, and high print quality. These machines are highly customizable and can be tailored to individual needs, whether for personal, professional, or industrial use. The key feature of Voron printers is the community's commitment to improving every aspect of the design, including mechanics, electronics, and firmware.
