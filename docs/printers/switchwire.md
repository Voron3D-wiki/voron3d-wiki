## What is a Switchwire

The Voron Switchwire is a bed-slinger-style printer that combines the simplicity of a traditional 3D printer with Voron's engineering excellence. It uses a CoreXZ motion system, where the bed moves along the Y-axis while the extruder moves along the X- and Z-axes, providing superior precision and speed compared to traditional bed slingers.

## Key Features
- **Motion System**: CoreXZ with bed slinger Y-axis
- **Build Volume**: 250 x 250 x 250mm (standard)
- **Frame**: Fully enclosed design with aluminum extrusions
- **Extruder**: Direct drive configuration
- **Hotend**: Compatible with various hotend options
- **Electronics**: Modular design with optional toolhead board
