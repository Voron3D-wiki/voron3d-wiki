<sup>By Chat-GPT</sup>

The **Voron Trident** is a hybrid design that combines elements from both the V1 and V2 models. It uses a fixed bed and moves the gantry along the Z-axis, employing three independent leadscrews for automatic bed leveling. This provides greater precision and ease of use compared to traditional leveling methods.

The Trident retains the enclosed frame and CoreXY motion system, offering the same high-speed performance and customization options as other Voron models. It is designed to be a robust, versatile printer, capable of producing high-quality prints consistently.

## **Key Features:**
- CoreXY motion system for speed and precision
- Fixed bed with 3-point Z-axis movement for automatic bed leveling
- Enclosed frame for better thermal management and print quality
- Highly customizable and available in multiple build sizes: 250mm, 300mm, and 350mm³

## **Applications:**
The Voron Trident is ideal for users who need a reliable, high-performance printer with easy bed leveling and minimal maintenance. It’s popular among both hobbyists and professionals looking for a robust, versatile 3D printer.
