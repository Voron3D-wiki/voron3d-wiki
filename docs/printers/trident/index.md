## What is a Trident

The Voron Trident is a hybrid design that combines the best features of the V1 and V2 models. It features a fixed gantry with a moving bed, utilizing three independent leadscrews for automatic bed leveling. This design provides exceptional precision and ease of use while maintaining the high-speed performance of the CoreXY motion system.
