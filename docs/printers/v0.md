# Voron V0

Official Voron Design link: [https://vorondesign.com/voron0](https://vorondesign.com/voron0)

Below is a generic image of what a Voron V0 can look like. Like all Voron 3D printers, the V0 can be highly customized to create whatever type of printer you would like.

![Voron V0 Example](https://i.redd.it/po0y0d65hzqa1.png)

## What is a V0

The Voron V0 is a small 3D printer with a build area of 120mmÂ³. This printer, like most Vorons, uses a CoreXY motion system where the bed moves as part of the Z-axis on a single lead screw.

## Differences between V0, V0.1, and V0.2

From the v0.1 to the v0.2 there were changes made to the x carage and the x linear rail

## Hardware Specifically Designed for the V0

Fysetc has created several mainboards and toolhead boards for their Voron V0 kits, some of which are also sold independently:

- [M36-HUB Toolhead Board](https://voron3d.wiki/en/configuration/toolhead-board/fysetc-M36)
    - this board has been shipped to customers but Fysetc has pulled all documentation from their github and not agknowledged that this board exists

- [Catalyst V1.0 mainboard](https://github.com/FYSETC/FYSETC-Voron-0.2-Pro/blob/main/0.2%20R1/Fysetc%20Voron%20V0.2%20R1%20umbilical%20Wiring.pdf)
    - this board was created specifically for the voron v0 and comes with its own toolhead board

- [Catalyst V2.0 mainboard]()
    - this board has been shipped to customers but Fysetc has pulled all documentation from their github and not agknowledged that this board exists

The Voron Desgin team has also created their own toolheadboard and umbilical desgin for the voron v0

- [Umbilical toolheadboard](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Hardware/blob/master/V0-Umbilical/README.md)

## Kit Reviews

(Add reviews here later.)

## Modifications

[Dragon Burner](https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron/tree/main/V0/Dragon_Burner)
 - a very popular alternative toolhead for the voron v0 that increases cooling with two 4010 fans

[tulip](https://github.com/Amekyras/tulip/tree/main)
 - a very very interesting project to switch the voron v0 to have front mounted belt tensioners, this reduces the force placed on the stepper motor shaft

[zero panel](https://github.com/zruncho3d/ZeroPanels)
 - replacement for drop nuts used to mount side panels

[BoxZero](https://github.com/zruncho3d/BoxZero)

[Tri-Zero](https://github.com/zruncho3d/tri-zero)
- triple independed belted z with mesh leveling
