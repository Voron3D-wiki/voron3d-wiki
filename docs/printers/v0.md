# Voron V0

Official Voron Design link: [https://vorondesign.com/voron0](https://vorondesign.com/voron0)

Below is a generic image of what a Voron V0 can look like. Like all Voron 3D printers, the V0 can be highly customized to create whatever type of printer you would like.

## What is a V0

The Voron V0 is a small 3D printer with a build area of 120mmÂ³. This printer, like most Vorons, uses a CoreXY motion system where the bed moves as part of the Z-axis on a single lead screw.

## Hardware Specifically Designed for the V0
[Siboor Voron V0 simple display](https://docs.siboor.com/other-products/v0-display-screen)


Fysetc has created several mainboards and toolhead boards for their Voron V0 kits, some of which are also sold independently:

- [M36-HUB Toolhead Board](https://voron3d.wiki/en/configuration/toolhead-board/fysetc-M36)
    - this board has been shipped to customers but Fysetc has pulled all documentation from their github and not agknowledged that this board exists

- [Catalyst V1.0 mainboard](https://github.com/FYSETC/FYSETC-Voron-0.2-Pro/blob/main/0.2%20R1/Fysetc%20Voron%20V0.2%20R1%20umbilical%20Wiring.pdf)
    - this board was created specifically for the voron v0 and comes with its own toolhead board

- [Catalyst V2.0 mainboard](https://github.com/FYSETC/Catalyst_Kit_V2.0)
    - fysetc's latests board for the voron V0

The Voron Desgin team has also created their own toolheadboard and umbilical desgin for the voron v0

- [Umbilical toolheadboard](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Hardware/blob/master/V0-Umbilical/README.md)
