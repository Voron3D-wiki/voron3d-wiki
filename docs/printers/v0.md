# Voron V0

Official Voron Design link: [https://vorondesign.com/voron0](https://vorondesign.com/voron0)

Below is a generic image of what a Voron V0 can look like. Like all Voron 3D printers, the V0 can be highly customized to create whatever type of printer you would like.

## What is a V0

The Voron V0 is a small 3D printer with a build area of 120mmÂ³. This printer, like most Vorons, uses a CoreXY motion system where the bed moves as part of the Z-axis on a single lead screw.

## Differences between V0, V0.1, and V0.2

(You can add specific differences here later.)

## Hardware Specifically Designed for the V0

Fysetc has created several mainboards and toolhead boards for their Voron V0 kits, some of which are also sold independently:

## Modifications

[tulip](https://github.com/Amekyras/tulip/tree/main)
 - a very very interesting project to switch the voron v0 to have front mounted belt tensioners, this reduces the force placed on the stepper motor shaft

 - replacement for drop nuts used to mount side panels

[Tri-Zero](https://github.com/zruncho3d/tri-zero)
- triple independed belted z with mesh leveling
