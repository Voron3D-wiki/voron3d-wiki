# E3D Revo Voron Hotend

![E3D Revo Voron Hotend](../../assets/e3d-revo-voron-image.jpg)

## Overview
The E3D Revo Voron is a revolutionary hotend developed in collaboration with the Voron Design team specifically for the Voron StealthBurner toolhead. It combines E3D's innovative RapidChange nozzle system with a compact, lightweight design optimized for high-performance CoreXY printers. The Revo Voron represents a significant advancement in hotend technology, allowing for tool-free nozzle changes at room temperature and improved thermal performance.

## Key Features

### RapidChange Nozzle System
- **Tool-Free Nozzle Changes**: Swap nozzles at room temperature using just your fingers - no tools or hot tightening required
- **Integrated Nozzle and Heatbreak**: Factory-sealed combination eliminates the risk of leakage and improves thermal performance
- **Variety of Nozzle Options**: Available in various sizes (0.15mm to 0.8mm) and materials (brass, ObXidian, high-temperature)

### HeaterCore Technology
- **Integrated Heater Design**: Thermistor, heater, and heater block combined into a single unit for superior thermal efficiency
- **Fast Heat-Up Times**: Reaches printing temperature in seconds rather than minutes
- **Positive Temperature Coefficient**: Power reduces as temperature increases, reducing hazards in thermal runaway situations

### Voron-Specific Design
- **Rigid 4-Point Mounting**: Uses four M3 x 0.5 bolts to secure firmly to the Voron StealthBurner
- **Ultra-Lightweight Construction**: Only 25g total weight for improved speed performance and reduced ringing
- **Anodized Aluminum Heatsink**: Available in red, blue, or grey to complement Voron color schemes

### Open Source Design
- **GPL V3 Licensed**: The heatsink design is open source, allowing for community modifications and improvements
- **Compatible with Voron Ecosystem**: Designed specifically for Voron printers and fully integrated with their ecosystem

## Nozzle Ecosystem

The Revo Voron uses E3D's RapidChange Revo nozzle system, which includes multiple options:

### Standard Flow Brass Nozzles
- Available in 0.15mm, 0.25mm, 0.4mm, 0.6mm, and 0.8mm diameters
- Suitable for standard materials like PLA, PETG, TPU, and ABS
- Max temperature: 300°C

### High Flow Brass Nozzles
- Available in 0.4mm, 0.6mm, and 0.8mm diameters
- Increases flow rates by approximately 70% compared to standard nozzles
- Perfect for speed printing applications

### ObXidian Nozzles
- Hard-wearing nozzles with E3DLC™ coating
- Resistant to abrasive filaments
- Non-stick properties ideal for sticky materials like PETG
- Available in standard and high flow variants

### High-Temperature HTX Nozzles
- Chromium Nitride coating for abrasion resistance
- Can operate at temperatures up to 500°C
- Ideal for engineering materials like Nylon, Polycarbonate, and PEEK

## Heatercore Options

### Standard 40W Heatercore
- Suitable for most printing applications
- Available in 12V and 24V versions
- Includes standard thermistor (max 300°C)

### High-Performance 60W Heatercore
- Recommended for high flow applications, extreme part cooling, or high-temperature printing
- Faster heat-up and more consistent temperatures under high demand
- Available in 12V and 24V versions

### High-Temperature Heatercores
- Available with PT100 or PT1000 temperature sensors
- Capable of reliable temperatures up to 450°C
- Ideal for engineering materials

## Installation Guide

1. **Prepare the StealthBurner**:
   - Ensure you have the correct StealthBurner printed parts for Revo Voron compatibility
   - Remove any existing hotend from your toolhead

2. **Mounting the Heatsink**:
   - Secure the heatsink to the toolhead using four M3 x 0.5 screws
   - Ensure the heatsink is oriented correctly according to Voron documentation

3. **Installing the HeaterCore**:
   - Insert the HeaterCore spring into the groove at the bottom of the heatsink
   - Push the HeaterCore into place until it locks securely
   - Connect the heater and thermistor wires to your control board

4. **Installing a Nozzle**:
   - Screw in your chosen Revo nozzle by hand until it's finger-tight
   - No heat tightening required

5. **Configuration**:
   - Update your firmware settings to match the HeaterCore specifications
   - Perform PID tuning to optimize temperature control

## Maintenance

1. **Nozzle Changes**: Simply unscrew the existing nozzle at room temperature and screw in a new one
2. **HeaterCore Replacement**: If needed, the HeaterCore can be easily removed and replaced
3. **Cleaning**: Standard nozzle cleaning techniques work well with Revo nozzles

## Benefits Over Traditional Hotends

1. **Convenience**: Tool-free nozzle changes make switching between different sizes effortless
2. **Speed**: Fast heat-up times reduce waiting between prints
3. **Performance**: Improved thermal efficiency and consistent extrusion
4. **Reliability**: Sealed nozzle-heatbreak units eliminate a common failure point
5. **Weight Reduction**: Ultra-lightweight design improves print quality
6. **Safety**: PTC design reduces thermal runaway risks
