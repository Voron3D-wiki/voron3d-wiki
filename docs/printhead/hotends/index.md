## Selection Guide

### Key Considerations

| Consideration          | Details                                        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Print Speed (flow rate) | Choose based on desired print speed, it doesn't matter fast your motion system is if you can't melt enough plastic            |
| Material Compatibility (abrasive materials) | Ensure support for intended filaments, if you plan on printing carbon fiber or glass fiber filaments a wear resistance hotend is reconemnd           |
| Cooling Performance    | Check heatsink and fan capabilities            |
| Maintenance Needs      | Consider ease of cleaning and part replacement, pay attention to what type of heate carterage it uses, and what thermistor it uses, this might not be important now but when you want cheap easily available replacement parts, you will be thankful |
