# What is the right nozzle for you?

    When choosing a nozzle for your printer that first thing to consider is the formfactor of the nozzle and what is compatiable with your 3dprinter. The common nozzle formats are V6 (M6 thread), volcano (longer m6), bambulab (TZ), FIN, etc. Once you have Identified the type of nozzle that you need, you need to consider what materials and tempuratures you plan on printing, abrasive filaments cause far more ware on your nozzle and it is recommened to use a hardened steal nozzle or an abrasive resistant nozzle. Nozzles are a ware item on 3d printers, it will slowly get worn out, the quetion is how quickly. For those that almost never replace nozzles and print with abrasive filaments, a dimondback nozzle can make sense, but for 99% of users it doesn't make sense.
