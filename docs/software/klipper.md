**[klipper Offical](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper)**

- [Klipper config cheat sheet](./klipper-config-help.md)

---

**[kiauh](https://github.com/dw-0/kiauh)**

- tool to help with installing and updating klipper plugins and extentions

---

**[moonraker](https://github.com/Arksine/moonraker)**
- Moonraker is a Python 3 based web server that exposes APIs with which client applications may use to interact with the 3D printing firmware Klipper. Communication between the Klippy host and Moonraker is done over a Unix Domain Socket. Tornado is used to provide Moonraker's server functionality.

---

**[mainsail](https://github.com/mainsail-crew/mainsail)**
- Makes Klipper more accessible by adding a lightweight, responsive web user interface, centred around an intuitive and consistent design philosophy.

---

**[fluidd](https://github.com/fluidd-core/fluidd)**
- webbased GUI for klipper 

---

**[klipperScreen](https://github.com/KlipperScreen/KlipperScreen)**
- A klipper extention that assists with configure a display
- Very helpful for using an old android phone as a klipper control panel
- KlipperScreen is a touchscreen GUI that interfaces with Klipper via Moonraker. It allows you to switch between multiple printers and access them from a single location. Notably, it doesn't need to run on the same host as your printer; you can install it on another device and configure the IP address to connect to the printer.

**[OctoPrint](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint)**

**[klipper Shake and Tune](https://github.com/Frix-x/klippain-shaketune)**
- This plugin contains a lot of features but it has quite a high learning curve and is ideal for people who want to tune their printers down to the last nanometers
- this can be used to create better input shaper graphs, such as the follow
- X axis Graph:
- ![voron-v0 shake and tune](./shakeAndtune/voron-v0.2-shakeandtune-X-min.png)

- Y axis Graph
- ![voron-v0 shake and tune](./shakeAndtune/voron-v0.2-shakeandtune-Y-min.png)

**[ResHelper](https://github.com/lhndo/ResHelper)**
- An alternative to klipper shake and tune (that can also be using alongside shake and tune) is ResHelper by lhndo
- uses stock klipper inputshaper code but automatically generates the graph for you, and gives you the ability to increase the freaquency if you want.

---

**[LED Effects for Klipper](https://github.com/julianschill/klipper-led_effect/tree/master)**
- This is the standalone repository of the Klipper LED Effects module developed by Paul McGowan with contributions from myself. It allows Klipper to run effects and animations on addressable LEDs, such as Neopixels, WS2812 or SK6812.
