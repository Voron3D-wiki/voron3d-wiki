## Hotend Selection Guide

### Factors to Consider
1. **Printing Temperature Requirements**
   - High-temperature materials need hotends with all-metal heat breaks
   - Standard materials can use PTFE-lined hotends

2. **Flow Rate Needs**
   - High-speed printing requires high-flow hotends
   - Detailed prints may benefit from standard or low-flow options

3. **Mounting Compatibility**
   - Ensure the hotend works with your printer's mounting system
   - Check compatibility with your extruder setup

4. **Nozzle Ecosystem**
   - Consider availability and cost of replacement nozzles
   - Specialty nozzles for specific materials or applications

## Maintenance Tips
- Regularly clean the nozzle to prevent clogs
- Check heat break and heat block connections for gaps
- Replace PTFE liners (if present) after extended high-temperature printing
- Keep spare nozzles on hand for quick replacement
