## Installation Guide

### Mounting Compatibility
Dragon hotends use the groove mount system and are compatible with:
- Most V6-compatible mounting systems
- Voron printer toolheads (Voron edition or with adapter)
- Many direct drive and Bowden extruder systems
- Aftermarket mounts and adapters

### Wiring Requirements
- 24V, 40W/50W heater cartridge
- Standard NTC 100K thermistor (compatible with PT1000)
- Standard wiring compatible with most control boards

### Installation Steps
1. Remove existing hotend assembly
2. Install the Dragon using appropriate mounting hardware
3. Connect heater cartridge and thermistor
4. Install preferred nozzle (tighten when hot)
5. Perform PID tuning before first use
6. Adjust your first layer settings as needed

## Printing Performance

### Material Compatibility
- **PLA/PETG**: Excellent performance
- **ABS/ASA**: Great thermal stability for consistent layers
- **TPU/TPE**: Good performance with flexible materials
- **Nylon/PC**: Handles engineering materials well
- **Carbon Fiber/Metal-filled**: Works with abrasive materials (with hardened nozzle)

### Speed Considerations
- **Standard Dragon**: Good for general printing speeds
- **Dragon HF**: Excellent for higher speed printing
- **Dragon UHF**: Designed for maximum speed printing

### Print Quality Factors
- Consistent extrusion even at high speeds
- Good thermal stability for layer consistency
- Reliable performance across various filament types

## Maintenance Tips

### Regular Maintenance
- Periodically check and tighten the heat break
- Inspect nozzle for wear, especially with abrasive materials
- Clean the heat block area of any filament debris
- Check for any signs of leaking between the heat break and nozzle

### Common Issues and Solutions
- **Filament Jams**: Check for heat creep or partial clogs
- **Temperature Fluctuations**: Verify thermistor installation
- **Leaking Filament**: Ensure proper hot tightening of nozzle
- **Reduced Flow Rate**: Check for partial clogs or worn nozzle
