# Toolhead Boards for 3D Printers

Toolhead boards make 3D printing more efficient by consolidating wiring on the moving toolhead. They simplify cable management and improve overall printer performance. Here are the best toolhead boards available, categorized by connection type:

## CAN Bus Toolhead Boards

### [MKS THR36 & THR42 Toolhead Board](./toolhead-board/MKS-THR.md)

The MKS THR36 & THR42 series of toolhead boards are designed to work with any printer that supports CAN bus or USB communication. These boards require either 24V or 12V power to operate, which is used to power the heater. They serve as a compelling alternative to BTT and Mellow boards due to their inclusion of three independently controllable fans.
